"""Shared island-production worker-pool configuration.

Unlike restaurant, which pins specific named waitresses to specific slots
(because the waitress identity determines a fixed sales bonus), production
slots don't need deterministic identity: the automation already OCRs the
finish time, so it never needs to know *which* character produced *what*
bonus. What it does need is a stamina-aware way to opportunistically staff
open slots from a ranked pool of characters, falling back to manjuu (fixed
E-grade, no stamina cost) when the pool is exhausted or everyone's resting.

Worker pools are scoped per production place (mine, ranch, cafe, etc.), and
further split per-slot for Ranch (102), since each ranch slot is a distinct,
fixed product (chicken/pig/cow/sheep) rather than an interchangeable general
slot. A character configured for one pool is not drafted into another,
except when that other place is fully idle for the day (the planner assigned
it zero production), in which case its pool is folded in as a lower-priority
fallback.

This module has no device or UI dependencies, matching restaurant_config.py.
